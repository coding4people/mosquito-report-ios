# MosquitoReportIOS

**MosquitoReport** is an app to report areas where mosquitoes could spread. Areas of stagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, and discarded tires, can be reported. The main goal is to support the combat against diseases like [Dengue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever), [Zika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever) and [Chikungunya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikungunya).
